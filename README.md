This project's goal is to show the close relationship between P/E ratios in a given year and the return in the next 10 years from that given year.

This project's goal is to show the close relationship between P/E ratios in a given year and the return in the next 10 years from that given year. This data set consists of monthly stocks prices, dividends, earnings and the consumer price index (to allow conversion to real values), all starting in January 1881.

Stocks prices data are monthly averages of daily closing prices.

I am using a Data set from Robert J. Shiller. http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm.
